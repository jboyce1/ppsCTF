This event stands as an opportunity to develop and showcase our students' prowess in offensive and defensive cyber operations, fostering their skills while providing a collaborative platform across our district. Ultimately, I would like to foster and guide a community of computer-savvy students to allow them to focus their energy on something that can be recognized and celebrated.  
Objective:  
The PPS Cyber Tactics Fest aims to immerse students in realistic cybersecurity scenarios, aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK framework and leveraging skills aligned with Carnegie Mellon University's PicoCTF and Cyber.org. This unique version of adversarial CFT should give students real-world and hands-on skills with the incentives that competition and gamification can provide.  
How You Can Contribute: 
•	Identify and support teams of up to 8 or up to 4 students from your classes. 
•	Agree to meet 1-2x per week with students on a MS Teams meeting while they discuss, learn from Cybersecurity students (Pitt & CMU) and practice their skills. 
•	Collaborate in evaluating students' skills to ensure fairness and competitiveness. 
 
Compensation and Resources: 
The union contract offers categories for extracurricular and co-curricular hours billed as after-school clubs. We aim to ensure students have timely access to resources and create spaces for teams to collaborate. A proposed commitment of 1 hour, 2 times per week via MS Teams, will aid in organizing the event and addressing students' queries. The pay is not ‘good’- but the contract allows you to bill the time you devote to this endeavor and I am really asking you spend some time helping your students through some of the challenges. 
Infrastructure and Mentorship: 
We have potential CMU, Pitt and DoD Cyber mentors available assist with the teams, so you will not be along. The organizers of the event (myself, until someone wants to help) will also ensure that all of the teams have access to the techniques that will be relevant for the challenge. Additionally, as a member of the US Army Reserve's Cyber Protection Team, I'm expanding mentorship and infrastructure opportunities for our students. 
Machine Capabilities: 
For 4-member teams: 
o	Two Cisco switches, a wireless hub per team, and potential server access. 
o	An airgapped network setup consisting of Linux Mint-based Optiplex 3010s/3020s running VirtualBox hosting Kali VMs and Ubuntu 21.04. 
o	Four Cisco switches, WRT54G wireless hub, and a robust server. 
o	Optiplex 3080s with Windows 11, dedicated for student logins and internet access. 
Competition Framework: 
The CTF aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, focusing on offensive and defensive strategies such as password cracking, deauthentication attacks, web exploitation, reconnaissance, information gathering, command and control acquisition, data exfiltration, and machine impact objectives. The innovative adversarial approach involves teams protecting their flags while attempting to access others'. 
Collaboration with PicoCTF: 
Aligning competition skills with PicoCTF prepares students and enhances their understanding of cybersecurity principles and tactics. Students will also have access to cyber.org resources as well as hackthebox tutorials that are relevant to the competition. 
Benefits for Your Staff and Students: 
•	Opportunity to guide and mentor students, fostering a supportive learning environment. 
•	Exposure to advanced cybersecurity tools and methodologies for enhanced teaching and learning. 
•	Access to course material, resources, and expertise for comprehensive skill development. 
 
Your dedication to this endeavor will significantly contribute to its success and offer our students an unparalleled learning experience in cybersecurity. Please reach out for further information or to express your interest in participating. Let's unite to make the PPS Cyber Tactics Fest a pivotal moment in our students' academic journey.
