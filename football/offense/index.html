    <!-- Analogies for each Tactic -->
    <div class="tactic" id="TA0043">
        <h3>TA0043 Reconnaissance</h3>
        <p>Like scouting opponents' games, watching tapes, and learning about their key players. This is gathering intel to plan future plays and strategies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tactic" id="TA0042">
        <h3>TA0042 Resource Development</h3>
        <p>Similar to off-season training, recruiting new players, and developing playbooks. It's about building and improving the team's capabilities and strategies for future games.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tactic" id="TA0001">
        <h3>TA0001 Initial Access</h3>
        <p>This can be likened to a team's first drive in a game, where the objective is to penetrate the opponent's defense and gain ground, akin to an adversary trying to breach a network.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tactic" id="TA0002">
        <h3>TA0002 Execution</h3>
        <p>Comparable to executing a specific play in football. It's the actual carrying out of a planned action, whether it's a running play, a pass, or a special teams play.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tactic" id="TA0003">
        <h3>TA0003 Persistence</h3>
        <p>This is akin to maintaining possession of the ball, continually advancing downfield play after play, much like an adversary wanting to maintain their presence in a system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tactic" id="TA0004">
        <h3>TA0004 Privilege Escalation</h3>
        <p>In football terms, this could be seen as gaining a strategic advantage, like moving from a standard play to a more dominant position on the field, or exploiting a weakness in the opposing team's defense.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tactic" id="TA0005">
        <h3>TA0005 Defense Evasion</h3>
        <p>This is like using deceptive plays, like a play-action pass or a double reverse, to avoid being read and countered by the defense.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tactic" id="TA0006">
        <h3>TA0006 Credential Access</h3>
        <p>This could be compared to intercepting communications or stealing signals from the opposing team, gaining insights into their plans and movements.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tactic" id="TA0007">
        <h3>TA0007 Discovery</h3>
        <p>Similar to analyzing the opponent's formation and tactics during a game to understand their strategy and adjust your plays accordingly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tactic" id="TA0008">
        <h3>TA0008 Lateral Movement</h3>
        <p>This is akin to the ball being passed around among team members, finding the best path through the defense to advance towards the goal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tactic" id="TA0009">
        <h3>TA0009 Collection</h3>
        <p>Comparable to a team gathering data on their performance, such as yards gained, to inform future plays or strategy adjustments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tactic" id="TA0011">
        <h3>TA0011 Command and Control</h3>
        <p>This can be seen as the quarterback or coach directing the team, calling plays, and making adjustments based on the game's progress.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tactic" id="TA0010">
        <h3>TA0010 Exfiltration</h3>
        <p>In football, this could be likened to a team taking possession of the ball (through an interception or fumble recovery) and moving it into their control to score.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tactic" id="TA0040">
        <h3>TA0040 Impact</h3>
        <p>This is similar to plays that disrupt or impact the opposing team's strategy, like a sack, a forced fumble, or a block, which directly affect the game's flow and the opponent's ability to execute their game plan.</p>
