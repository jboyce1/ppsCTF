Explanation:
  find . -name "*.zip": Finds all .zip files starting from the current directory (.).
  -exec unzip -o {}: Executes the unzip command on each zip file found. The -o flag forces overwriting of existing files without prompting.
  -d {}_extracted: Extracts the contents of each zip file into a folder named after the zip file, appending _extracted to the folder name.
