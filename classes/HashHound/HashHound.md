## Part 1: Fun New Game

### Specific Skills
- Use terminal to develop an md5sum hash of a string
- Determine the md5sum hash of a file
- Determine the md5sum has of multiple files
- Create a text document from a command output
- Use grep to search for a specific output in a list
- Use find, cut, and grep to find a unknown hash from a list of known hashes

**To find a hash in terminal:**     
  ```bash
  echo -n YourStingHere | md5sum
  ```      
  Output looks like: 26617986d9bafa5795a2c63fe209781e -

### To complete the challenges, you will need to download them on a Linux device (e.g. Kali through cyber.org) 
  - Step 1: Click the link to open a new page
  - Step 2: Download the .zip file by clicking the ‚ÄòDownload‚Äô button on the top left of the page
  - Step 3: Go to your Downloads folder and find the file
  - Step 4: Right click and extract the file
  - Step 5: Go and find the Flag (watch the video, remember flags look like;

## Part2: Needle in the Hayloft

  Here is your md5sum needle: c6fca9b96af058081fe4bfd89523f3f4

  step1: Navigate to the '2 Needle in the Hayloft' directory    
  step2: Make a text file using the following command:
  **`find . -type f -exec md5sum {} \; > 01md5sums.txt`**
    
    Explaination for command    
      -    **`find .`** searches for files and directories starting from the current directory (.).    
      -    **`-type f`** specifies that we are interested in files only, not directories.    
      -    **`-exec md5sum {} \;`** executes the md5sum command on each file found by find. {} represents the current file being processed by find.    
      -    **`> md5sums.txt`** redirects the output (MD5 checksums) to a file named md5sums.txt.    
   
  step3: open the text file and search (ctrl+f) the needle you are looking for        
  step4: open the file and find the flag
    
      For more informaiton on the find functions, read the manual: 
      man find

## Part 3: Coming to Greps with the Past

### Suspicious Needle Search

  You need to find the suspicious needle. They were all good when they left but something changed. The `knowngood_md5sums_filenames.txt` is a list of all the unsuspicious files.

  **step1:** Navigate to the directory containing `knowngood_md5sums_filenames.txt`  
  
  **step2:** Extract all of the hashes from the `knowngood_md5sums_filenames.txt` using the command:  
  `cut -d ' ' -f 1 knowngood_md5sums_filenames.txt > knowngood_hashes.txt`  
  
  **Explanation for command**  
  - `cut -d ' '` specifies the delimiter as a space.  
  - `-f 1` selects the first field, which is typically the hash value.  
  - `> knowngood_hashes.txt` redirects the output to a file named `knowngood_hashes.txt`.  
  
  **step3:** Find all the MD5 sums in the directory using the command:  
  `find . -type f -exec md5sum {} \; > current_md5sums_filenames.txt`  
  
  **step4:** Extract all hashes from the `current_md5sums_filenames.txt` using:  
  `cut -d ' ' -f 1 current_md5sums_filenames.txt > current_hashes.txt`  
  
  **step5:** Search for lines in `current_hashes.txt` that are not in `knowngood_hashes.txt` and write them to a new file called `non_matching_hashes.txt` using:  
  `grep -vf knowngood_hashes.txt current_hashes.txt > non_matching_hashes.txt`  
  
  **step6:** Find and inspect all the files in the `non_matching_hashes.txt` by finding (ctrl+f) the hashes in the `current_md5sums_filenames.txt` or use `grep` again to find these files:  
  `grep -F -f non_matching_hashes.txt current_md5sums_filenames.txt`
