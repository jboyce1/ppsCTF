### Specific Skills:
- Use terminal to develop an md5sum hash of a string
- Determine the md5sum hash of a file
- Determine the md5sum hash of multiple files
- Create a text document from a command output
- Use `grep` to search for a specific output in a list
- Use `find`, `cut`, and `grep` to find an unknown hash from a list of known hashes

# Part 1: use md5sum in terminal   
## Fun New Game    

### Finding a Hash in Terminal
`echo -n YourStringHere | md5sum`

  Output looks like: `26617986d9bafa5795a2c63fe209781e -`    

### To complete the challenges, you will need to download them on a Linux device (e.g. Kali through cyber.org)

1. **Click the link** to open a new page.  
2. **Download the `.zip` file** by clicking the ‚ÄòDownload‚Äô button on the top left of the page.  
3. **Go to your Downloads folder** and locate the file.  
4. **Right-click and extract** the file.  
5. **Find the Flag** (watch the video, remember flags look like `pps{someflag}`).  
6. **Click the ‚ÄúFlag‚Äù link** after the practice and paste your flag to see if it is correct.

# Part 2: use find with the -type and -exec flags to create a file of md5sums
## Needle in the Hayloft  
  
Here is your md5sum needle: c6fca9b96af058081fe4bfd89523f3f4  
  
step1: Navigate to the '2 Needle in the Hayloft' directory    
step2: Make a text file using the following command:  
**`find . -type f -exec md5sum {} \; > 01md5sums.txt`**  

- Explaination for command      
  - **`find .`** searches for files and directories starting from the current directory (.).    
  - **`-type f`** specifies that we are interested in files only, not directories.    
  - **`-exec md5sum {} \;`** executes the md5sum command on each file found by find. {} represents the current file being processed by find.    
  - **`> md5sums.txt`** redirects the output (MD5 checksums) to a file named md5sums.txt.    
  
step3: open the text file and search (ctrl+f) the needle you are looking for       
step4: open the file and find the flag  

For more informaiton on the find functions, read the manual:   
man find

# Part 3: use find, cut, and grep to isolate suspcious files 
## Coming to Greps with the Past  
  
### Suspicious Needle Search  

You need to find the suspicious needle. They were all good when they left but something changed. The `knowngood_md5sums_filenames.txt` is a list of all the unsuspicious files.  
  
**step1:** Navigate to the directory containing `knowngood_md5sums_filenames.txt`  
**step2:** Extract all of the hashes from the `knowngood_md5sums_filenames.txt` using the command:  
`cut -d ' ' -f 1 knowngood_md5sums_filenames.txt > knowngood_hashes.txt`  
  
- Explanation for command
  - `cut -d ' '` specifies the delimiter as a space.
  - `-f 1` selects the first field, which is typically the hash value.
  - `> knowngood_hashes.txt` redirects the output to a file named `knowngood_hashes.txt`.  
  
**step3:** Find all the MD5 sums in the directory using the command:    
`find . -type f -exec md5sum {} \; > current_md5sums_filenames.txt`    
  
**step4:** Extract all hashes from the `current_md5sums_filenames.txt` using:  
`cut -d ' ' -f 1 current_md5sums_filenames.txt > current_hashes.txt`  

**step5:** Search for lines in `current_hashes.txt` that are not in `knowngood_hashes.txt` and write them to a new file called `non_matching_hashes.txt` using:    
`grep -vf knowngood_hashes.txt current_hashes.txt > non_matching_hashes.txt`    
  
**step6:** Find and inspect all the files in the `non_matching_hashes.txt` by finding (ctrl+f) the hashes in the `current_md5sums_filenames.txt` or use `grep` again to find these files:    
`grep -F -f non_matching_hashes.txt current_md5sums_filenames.txt`
