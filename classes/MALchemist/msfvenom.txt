Unfortunately, this payload can leave conspicuous evil-looking entries in the apache error logs, so it is probably a good idea to use a bind or reverse shell unless firewalls prevent them from working. The issue this payload takes advantage of (CLOEXEC flag not set on sockets) appears to have been patched on the Ubuntu version of Apache and may not work on other Debian-based distributions. Only tested on Apache but it might work on other web servers that leak file descriptors to child processes.

    windows/x64/peinject/bind_ipv6_tcp                                 Inject a custom native PE file into the exploited process using a reflective PE loader. The reflective PE loader will execute the pre-mapped PE image starting from the address of entry after performing image base relocation and API address resolution. This module requires a PE file that contains relocation data and a valid (uncorrupted) import table. PE files with CLR(C#/.NET executables), bounded imports, and TLS callbacks are not currently supported. Also PE files which use resource loading might crash. Listen for an IPv6 connection (Windows x64)
