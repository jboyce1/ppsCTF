Phase 1:

- set up the tcp_udp_icmp_cyberbully.py on an ubuntu-bully box using the ubuntu-victims IP 

- install iftop on victim machine
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y iftop

have participants ssh into victim computer 
find active connections iftop

find the interet connection using ip addr

find the top connections using iftop
iftop 

sudo tcpdump -i <interface> -q --number | grep -v ssh | grep -v domain
OR 
sudo tcpdump -i <interface> -q --number | grep -Ev "ssh|domain"


sudo tcpdump -i ens5
once you have the device attacked we can try to ping flood attack to bully to see if the the packets decrease in volume:
sudo ping -f -s 65000 <BULLY-IP>

Phase 2: Set up wireshark on local machines
- set up the icmp_broadcast_to_net.py and let it run while getting the students set up on their boxes with wireshark

turn on wireshark and inspect captured packets
