- 2-4+ remote hours per week (depending on your team and involvement level) during the practice season February-April:

    -- Cyber.org accounts: These are Kali Linux attack boxes designed to exploit vulnerabilities and conduct 'penetration tests.' They are on a separate network (a 'range') provided by cyber.org at no cost and can be accessed by your personal computer or by a school laptop.

    -- Work role training: There were 7 "work roles" last year, which are collections of specific skills needed to capture flags during the competition.

        --- These are presented from 7-9pm one night per week.

        --- Each skill has explicit directions and a video walkthrough on how to complete the task.

        --- Each skill has a series of challenges that allow you to practice the skill while the skill is being presented.

    -- Group Challenges: These are challenges designed specifically for teams to practice conducting operations as a team.

    -- Individual Challenges: These are work-role specific challenges.

- Optional Saturdays in March-April from 9am-1pm at the Gifted Center to practice on the competition lab:

    -- There is pizza, and usually some LAN gaming involved.

- One week worth of competition during the school day April 21-25th:

    -- Depending on your team's performance and the tournament schedule.

_________________________________________________________________________________________



For those of you who participated last year, I have a couple of new things that will be added this year:

    - Outside school districts will be participating with teams of 8 (two so far).

    - More outside organizations will be helping serve as mentors (CMU, Army, Cyversity, Blackgirlshack).

    - RSA Public/Private key tunneling and multiplexing (tunnels inside of tunnels).

    - Proxychains for using Kali tools through tunnel chains.

    - Reverse engineering for flags using Ghidra.

_________________________________________________________________________________________



I also have some things 'in the works' that have not come to fruition yet, but I am both hopeful and tenacious:

    - Opportunities for merit-based CompTIA Sec+ or PenTest+ Vouchers (for Juniors/Seniors).

    - Pizza shop "sponsorship" for Saturdays.

    - Escape Room sponsorship for teams to practice their skills off the keyboard.

I'll be in touch with more information soon. In the meantime, your school needs between 6-8 members on the team to successfully compete. Encourage your classmates to take the challenge.
