    <h1>Cybersecurity Chess</h1>

    <div class="chess-piece">
        <h2>Pawn (1 point)</h2>
        <p><b>Basic reconnaissance:</b> Involves initial gathering of information about the target network. Identifies open ports, services, and subdomains without aggressive interaction.</p>
        <p><b>Scanning and enumeration:</b> More in-depth analysis to discover vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the network's defenses, like outdated software or unprotected entry points.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chess-piece">
        <h2>Knight (3 points)</h2>
        <p><b>Initial access:</b> Achieving user-level access to a host or non-critical system, often through exploiting known vulnerabilities or social engineering tactics.</p>
        <p><b>Lateral movement:</b> Spreading across the network from the initial entry point, seeking higher privileges or more sensitive data, without yet gaining full control.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chess-piece">
        <h2>Bishop (5 points)</h2>
        <p><b>Privileged access:</b> Gaining higher-level permissions, potentially including administrator rights, to access more critical systems or data.</p>
        <p><b>Data exfiltration:</b> Transferring sensitive data from the target network to the attacker, often stealthily to avoid detection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chess-piece">
        <h2>Rook (7 points)</h2>
        <p><b>Persistence:</b> Establishing mechanisms to maintain access over time, often through backdoors or other covert methods.</p>
        <p><b>Escalation of privileges:</b> Expanding access rights, often by exploiting system flaws, to gain higher level of control over network resources.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chess-piece">
        <h2>Queen (10 points)</h2>
        <p><b>Root access:</b> Achieving the highest level of system access, allowing complete control over the network, akin to the most powerful chess piece.</p>
        <p><b>Complete control:</b> Gaining authority over critical systems, which can include altering or halting essential operations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chess-piece">
        <h2>Checkmate (15 points)</h2>
        <p><b>Complete compromise:</b> Achieving full dominion over the target network, including root access, data theft, and the ability to disrupt operations, representing a decisive victory.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chess-piece">
        <h2>Position (Bonus Points)</h2>
        <p><b>Mate in 3 (5 bonus points):</b> Securing a strategic position within the network, such as root privileges on an admin account or running command-and-control operations, reflecting a significant tactical advantage.</p>
    </div>
