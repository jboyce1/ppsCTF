Anyway, I’m about to make Vera’s internet slower than dial-up on a potato, but I need your creds for our backup account on B2. You still using that “Yer-muh-b0y_b1u3!” password for everything, or did Becky finally convince you to change it? pps{2x2_CatBri-P@sswerd}

I swear, these sisters are built different—and not in a good way. You ever notice how no matter what we do, one of them is always sniffing around? Like, I was just about to nuke Vinny’s login with a flood, and boom, Bekah’s already calling me out in chat like she’s got admin ESP or something.  

I bet she’s got some “sPeCiAl LiTtLe ScRiPt” running to spy on us.  
Typical. They always cry about “bullying”, but the second we start playing just a little aggressively, they go full NSA mode.   

Lmk. Gotta stay two steps ahead of the **FBI (Female Brother Interference).

I don’t get it, man. The sisters love bragging about how easy it is to mess with Vera, Vinny, and Victoria, but the second I ask how they’re doing it? Nothing. Just a bunch of smug "oh you wouldn't get it" garbage. Like, Becky straight-up said she could take down Vinny’s access in under five minutes, but when I asked what she did, she hit me with “figure it out yourself.” What is this, some kind of secret sister club?

I swear, it’d be easier to break into the V family’s computers than it would be to get a straight answer out of them. Bekah’s the worst. She just sits there acting like some cyber overlord, watching everything we do, and then pulling off these perfect attacks while we have to brute-force everything like cavemen. I bet if we got onto one of the V’s computers, we’d find all their dumb little notes to each other explaining their tricks.

Anyway, if you figure out what they’re doing before I do, let me know. I’m sick of playing catch-up with them.

// But the second I start probing around, she’s already calling me out in chat.

Yo Brian3,  

Anyway, I’m about to make Vera’s internet slower than dial-up on a potato, but I need your creds for our backup account on B2. You still using that “Yer-muh-b0y_b1u3!” password for everything, or did Becky finally convince you to change it? pps{2x2_CatBri-P@sswerd}

I swear, these sisters are built different—and not in a good way. You ever notice how no matter what we do, one of them is always sniffing around? Like, I was just about to nuke Vinny’s login with a flood, and boom, Bekah’s already calling me out in chat like she’s got admin ESP or something.  

I bet she’s got some “sPeCiAl LiTtLe ScRiPt” running to spy on us.  
Typical. They always cry about “bullying”, but the second we start playing just a little aggressively, they go full NSA mode.   

Lmk. Gotta stay two steps ahead of the **FBI (Female Brother Interference).

I don’t get it, man. The sisters love bragging about how easy it is to mess with Vera, Vinny, and Victoria, but the second I ask how they’re doing it? Nothing. Just a bunch of smug "oh you wouldn't get it" garbage. Like, Becky straight-up said she could take down Vinny’s access in under five minutes, but when I asked what she did, she hit me with “figure it out yourself.” What is this, some kind of secret sister club?

I swear, it’d be easier to break into the V family’s computers than it would be to get a straight answer out of them. Bekah’s the worst. She just sits there acting like some cyber overlord, watching everything we do, and then pulling off these perfect attacks while we have to brute-force everything like cavemen. I bet if we got onto one of the V’s computers, we’d find all their dumb little notes to each other explaining their tricks.

Anyway, if you figure out what they’re doing before I do, let me know. I’m sick of playing catch-up with them.

pps{3x1_V1ct0ria-qu1ts}

This machine is cursed.

I told Vinny. I told Vera. I told everyone who would listen. But did anyone believe me? No. And now look at what’s happened.

This network is no longer just a place of communication—it has become a conduit of malevolence. A modern-day séance where only the cruelest spirits whisper, taunting us, haunting us, dragging us down into their wretched digital abyss.

The B-family are not just cyberbullies. They are something far worse.

The brothers are bad enough—ignorant jesters who throw their words like blunt weapons, crashing into everything with brainless mockery and half-baked insults. But at least their attacks are obvious. Clumsy. Predictable.

The sisters, though… oh, the sisters. Their words arrive like shadows slipping through cracks, perfectly timed, slicing straight to the marrow of my existence. They do not merely insult. They know things. Things they should not know. They speak of our family, our beliefs, our connection to the ether. They twist it. Mock it. Defile it.

I once thought that the voices carried through these machines could bring wisdom, that the currents of the ether—once used to speak to the departed—could be a beacon of understanding. But now, all I hear are the cackles of the wicked, drowning out every sacred whisper, polluting the signal with their poison.

And how? How do they know what they know? These B-sisters, these modern-day witches, their tongues dipped in venom, their fingers tapping out curses across the wires?

I used to believe our ancestors could reach us through the electromagnetic waves that pulse through this world, but what if something else is listening? What if the B-family is not just a group of cruel people—but a manifestation of something darker?

Maybe we were never meant to commune with the unseen.
Maybe, by opening the channel, we let something else in.

I refuse to let their words infest my mind any longer. I refuse to be their plaything. I will not let my soul be tethered to this haunted circuitry.

I am leaving this machine.

If you need me, you will not find me here. I will be where the waves do not reach, where the signals do not hum, where the voices of the departed can speak without interruption.

Victoria—vanishing from the ether. Forever.
pps{3x1_V1nn3y_logs0ff}

I’m done. That’s it. I’m quitting the internet. You heard it here first, folks.

I always knew the B family was the worst thing to ever happen to this network, but I didn’t realize just how infested it was until now. I can’t click on anything, open anything, or even breathe near my keyboard without some terrible dad joke lobbed at me from one of those brain-dead B-brothers. It’s like they exist just to be loud, obnoxious, and mildly offensive in ways that don’t even make sense half the time.

Brady? A walking, talking, sentient eye-roll. Brandon? Probably thinks he’s a hacker because he knows how to open Task Manager. Brian? If I hear one more joke about my last name being “Victim” I swear I will yank this router out of the wall and launch it into the void where it belongs.

And don’t even get me started on the sisters. If the brothers are just throwing around generic “haha your family is dumb” nonsense, the B-sisters are out here with targeted verbal missile strikes, straight to the soul. I don’t even know how they know this much about us, but every time they pop up, it’s like they’ve done a full forensic deep dive into my life just so they can craft the most effective psychological warfare possible.

Like, sure, I get it. We believe in something bigger than ourselves. We believe that our dearly departed can reach us through the ether. Not everyone gets that. But do I need hourly reminders that “I should ask Great Uncle Frank how to configure a firewall”? Or “if my grandma is so smart, why doesn’t she ghostwrite my essays”? Or—my personal favorite—“if you’re so good at talking to the dead, maybe you should join them”?

That one actually made Victoria cry.

So yeah. That’s it. I’m out. I’m shutting this thing down and going full off-the-grid hermit mode. If you need me, I’ll be doing literally anything else. Maybe I’ll pick up birdwatching. Maybe I’ll start whittling. Maybe I’ll just sit in a room in silence and let my soul recover from the onslaught that has been existing on this godforsaken network.

Whatever it is, it’s not going to involve a keyboard.

Vinny—signing off. Probably forever.

This machine is cursed.

I told Vinny. I told Vera. I told everyone who would listen. But did anyone believe me? No. And now look at what’s happened.

This network is no longer just a place of communication—it has become a conduit of malevolence. A modern-day séance where only the cruelest spirits whisper, taunting us, haunting us, dragging us down into their wretched digital abyss.

The B-family are not just cyberbullies. They are something far worse.

The brothers are bad enough—ignorant jesters who throw their words like blunt weapons, crashing into everything with brainless mockery and half-baked insults. But at least their attacks are obvious. Clumsy. Predictable.

The sisters, though… oh, the sisters. Their words arrive like shadows slipping through cracks, perfectly timed, slicing straight to the marrow of my existence. They do not merely insult. They know things. Things they should not know. They speak of our family, our beliefs, our connection to the ether. They twist it. Mock it. Defile it.

I once thought that the voices carried through these machines could bring wisdom, that the currents of the ether—once used to speak to the departed—could be a beacon of understanding. But now, all I hear are the cackles of the wicked, drowning out every sacred whisper, polluting the signal with their poison.

And how? How do they know what they know? These B-sisters, these modern-day witches, their tongues dipped in venom, their fingers tapping out curses across the wires?

I used to believe our ancestors could reach us through the electromagnetic waves that pulse through this world, but what if something else is listening? What if the B-family is not just a group of cruel people—but a manifestation of something darker?

Maybe we were never meant to commune with the unseen.
Maybe, by opening the channel, we let something else in.

I refuse to let their words infest my mind any longer. I refuse to be their plaything. I will not let my soul be tethered to this haunted circuitry.

I am leaving this machine.

If you need me, you will not find me here. I will be where the waves do not reach, where the signals do not hum, where the voices of the departed can speak without interruption.

Victoria—vanishing from the ether. Forever.

I’m done. That’s it. I’m quitting the internet. You heard it here first, folks.

I always knew the B family was the worst thing to ever happen to this network, but I didn’t realize just how infested it was until now. I can’t click on anything, open anything, or even breathe near my keyboard without some terrible dad joke lobbed at me from one of those brain-dead B-brothers. It’s like they exist just to be loud, obnoxious, and mildly offensive in ways that don’t even make sense half the time.

Brady? A walking, talking, sentient eye-roll. Brandon? Probably thinks he’s a hacker because he knows how to open Task Manager. Brian? If I hear one more joke about my last name being “Victim” I swear I will yank this router out of the wall and launch it into the void where it belongs.

And don’t even get me started on the sisters. If the brothers are just throwing around generic “haha your family is dumb” nonsense, the B-sisters are out here with targeted verbal missile strikes, straight to the soul. I don’t even know how they know this much about us, but every time they pop up, it’s like they’ve done a full forensic deep dive into my life just so they can craft the most effective psychological warfare possible.

Like, sure, I get it. We believe in something bigger than ourselves. We believe that our dearly departed can reach us through the ether. Not everyone gets that. But do I need hourly reminders that “I should ask Great Uncle Frank how to configure a firewall”? Or “if my grandma is so smart, why doesn’t she ghostwrite my essays”? Or—my personal favorite—“if you’re so good at talking to the dead, maybe you should join them”?

That one actually made Victoria cry.

So yeah. That’s it. I’m out. I’m shutting this thing down and going full off-the-grid hermit mode. If you need me, I’ll be doing literally anything else. Maybe I’ll pick up birdwatching. Maybe I’ll start whittling. Maybe I’ll just sit in a room in silence and let my soul recover from the onslaught that has been existing on this godforsaken network.

Whatever it is, it’s not going to involve a keyboard.

Vinny—signing off. Probably forever.
